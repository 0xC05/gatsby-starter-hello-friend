 Hello Friend

![Hello Friend](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend/blob/master/images/screenshot.png?raw=true)

This starter was made to help you present your ideas easier. We all know how hard is to start something on the web, especially these days. You need to prepare a bunch of stuff, configure them and when that’s done — create the content.

This starter is pretty basic and covers all of the essentials. All you have to do is start typing!

### DEMO - https://gatsby-hello-friend.now.sh/
